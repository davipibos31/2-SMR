    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe makes a quick and tasty hummus, without the mess. It has been adapted from several different recipes that I have
read over the years.</p>
<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste that is used a lot in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty
with salad, grilled meats and pita bread.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 can (400 g) chickpeas (chickpeas)</li>
  <li>175 g tahini</li>
  <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
  <li>Half a red pepper</li>
  <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
  <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
      <li>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and
coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta
cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it
for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should
definitely discard it.</p>
<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of
months.</p>
