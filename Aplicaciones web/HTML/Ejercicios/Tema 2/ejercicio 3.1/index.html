    <h1>People first</h1>
    <p>MSF was officially created on December 22, 1971. At that time, 300 volunteers were part of the
organization: <em>doctors, nurses, and other staff, including the 13 founding doctors and journalists</em>.</p>
  <p>MSF was created with the belief that all people have the right to medical care regardless of their
<em>gender, race, religion, creed or political affiliation</em>, and that the needs of these people exceed respect for the
national borders</p>
