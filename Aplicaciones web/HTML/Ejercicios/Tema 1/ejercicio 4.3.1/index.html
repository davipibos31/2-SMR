    <h1>Poems Exercise</h1>
    <h2>Here by Octavio Paz</h2>
    <p>My steps on this street</p>
    <p>summary</p>
    <p>In another street</p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p>I hear my steps</p>
    <p>Pass on this street</p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p>Only the fog is real</p>
    <h2>To a General by Julio Cortazar</h2>
    <p>Dirty hands region of hairless brushes</p>
    <p>Kids upside down from toothbrushes</p>
    <p>Zone where the rat ennobles itself</p>
    <p>And there are countless flags and they sing hymns</p>
    <p>And someone turns you on, son of a bitch</p>
    <p>a medal on the chest</p>
    <p>And you rot the same.</p>
    <h2>Mario Benedetti syndrome</h2>
    <p>I still have almost all my teeth</p>
    <p>almost all my hair and very few reeds</p>
    <p>I can make and undo love</p>
    <p>climb a ladder two at a time and run forty meters behind the bus</p>
    <p>and run forty meters behind the bus</p>
    <p>so i shouldn't feel old</p>
    <p>but the serious problem is that before</p>
    <p>or I was looking at these details.</p>
