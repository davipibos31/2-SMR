      Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to
be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to
do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.
Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

      You know how sports teach kids teamwork and how to be strong and brave and confident?

My parents are both very funny but they're also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while
 I'm just a lunatic. I don't know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I'm just glad
