      <p>
        Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,<br />
        Or like a fairy trip upon the green,<br />
        Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,<br />
        Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:<br />
        Love is a spirit all compact of fire,<br />
        Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
      </p>

      <p>When you look at me<br>
        my eyes are keys,<br>
        the wall has secrets,<br>
        my fear words, poems.<br>
        Only you make my memory,<br>
        a fascinated traveler,<br>
        an incessant fire.
